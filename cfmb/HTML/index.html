                    Welcome to the Center for Individual and Community Development through Scientific Research webpage! We are
                    dedicated to promoting the development of individuals and communities, with a focus on marginalized groups
                    such as disabled and uneducated individuals from the Dalit community. Through our scientific research, we
                    strive to improve their lives and contribute to the betterment of society as a whole. Explore the sections
                    below to learn more about our research areas and initiatives.

                <b>Tissue Culture:</b>
                In this section, we conduct research on tissue culture techniques for various species,
                including orchids, fruits, and bananas. We aim to enhance the production and distribution of these plants
                through advanced tissue culture methods. Accompanied by vivid pictures and diagrams, this section showcases
                our expertise in tissue culture and its potential benefits.
